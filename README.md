Optimizing neuromodulation in multicompartmental neuron model.

### Tutorial for setting up neuromodulation for single cell models

See examples/ for Jupyter Notebook on dSPN optimization and analysis


# Install

To use Neuromodcell, you first have to install [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download) on your machine , then install Neuromodcell via

```
pip install neuromodcell

```

# Models

The multicompartmental models should have morphology file (SWC), mechanisms.json (JSON) and parameters.json (JSON) files. See examples/models/dspn for examples of dSPN multicompartmental models. 

# Testing

Uses pytest. To execute, run:

```
pytest tests/
```

REMOVE: complied mechanisms (eg. x86_64/-folder, depends on CPU architecture) before running tests again!
