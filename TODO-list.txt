## Neuromodcell

2023-10-feb 
All tests pass and the simulation give a good result

### Issues
Low code coverage for tests
The selection is based on ID not parameterkey - should be both ?
Syntactic issues - write and comment all parts better


## Neuromodulation-software

1. check functionality of synapse based modulation - maybe rewrite completely at a later date!
2. Clean up the gitignore file!

### Synatx comments
Line 140 in neuromodulation.py !!! Get the synapse in a better way


# General
1. Check that everything works!
2. Check again!
3. Check standards!
